<h1>Creating Project</h1>

<p>
	Cypal Studio for GWT, is implemented as a WTP Facet. This means you won't find any New Cypal Studio Project, 
	rather you can install the facet on any standarad Dynamic Web Project.
<p>	
	To create a new Dynamic Web Project, click New->Project and in the wizard select Dynamic Web Project. 
	In the next page of the wizard select "Cypal Studio GWT Project" in the configuration drop down before finishing the wizard.
<p>	
	If you already have a Dynamic Web Project and want to add Cypal Studio's GWT Facet to it, go to the "Project Facets" page of the project's properties.
	You can add the facet from the "Add/Remove Project Facets..." button.
