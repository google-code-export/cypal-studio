<p>
	Compilation can be done from the GWT Shell's 'Compile' button.

	Cypal Studio for GWT will automatically invoke GWT compiler during a Clean Build and also when deploying to an external server.
	Both these operations are controlled by preferences
	
	The output of the GWT Compiler is by default created in build/gwtOutput folder. This location can be changed in the preferences. The command output of the GWT Compiler will be shown in the Console view.
